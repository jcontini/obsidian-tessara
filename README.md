# Tessera

> An AI-enhanced journaling and self-reflection companion for Obsidian.

## Overview
Tessera is an Obsidian plugin that creates an interactive journaling experience where AI helps you explore thoughts and maintain an evolving personal context. It acts as both a conversation partner and an intelligent biographer, helping you:

- Engage in natural, reflective conversations
- Automatically capture and organize personal context
- Build a structured, local "autobiography" over time
- Maintain continuity across conversations without repetition

### Key Features
- **Intelligent Context Management**
  - Automatically organizes personal information into themed markdown files
  - Creates and updates files like goals.md, relationships.md, etc.
  - Splits and reorganizes content as themes develop
  - Maintains a central autobiography.md with links to specific context files

- **Natural Conversation Flow**
  - Engages in reflective dialogue
  - Asks permission before saving important context
  - Suggests relevant topics based on conversation
  - Maintains conversation continuity using saved context

- **Privacy-First Design**
  - All context stored locally in markdown files
  - Compatible with any LLM (including local models)
  - Full control over what information is saved
  - Portable context that works across different AI models
